        <p>A <b>pencil</b> (<xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English" format="html" scope="external">/ˈpɛnsəl/</xref>
            <xref href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/f/f9/En-us-pencil.ogg/En-us-pencil.ogg.mp3" format="html" scope="external"/><sup><xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-us-pencil.ogg" format="html" scope="external">ⓘ</xref></sup>) is a <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing" format="html" scope="external">writing</xref> or <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing" format="html" scope="external">drawing</xref> implement with a solid <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment" format="html" scope="external">pigment</xref> core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage, and keeps it from marking the user's hand.</p>
        <p>Pencils create marks by physical <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(mechanical)" format="html" scope="external">abrasion</xref>, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper" format="html" scope="external">paper</xref> or other surface. They are distinct from <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen" format="html" scope="external">pens</xref>, which dispense liquid or gel <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink" format="html" scope="external">ink</xref> onto the marked surface.</p>
        <p>Most pencil cores are made of <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite" format="html" scope="external">graphite</xref> powder mixed with a <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay" format="html" scope="external">clay</xref> binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as "lead pencils") produce grey or black marks that are easily <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraser" format="html" scope="external">erased</xref>, but otherwise resistant to <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture" format="html" scope="external">moisture</xref>, most chemicals, <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation" format="html" scope="external">ultraviolet radiation</xref> and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal_(art)" format="html" scope="external">those of charcoal</xref>, are mainly used for drawing and <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_(drawing)" format="html"
                scope="external">sketching</xref>. <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloured_pencils" format="html" scope="external">Coloured pencils</xref> are sometimes used by teachers or editors <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_pencil_(editing)" format="html" scope="external">to correct submitted texts</xref>, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_pencil" format="html" scope="external">Grease pencils</xref> have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass" format="html" scope="external">glass</xref> or <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain" format="html" scope="external">porcelain</xref>.</p>
        <p>The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon" format="html" scope="external">hexagonal</xref> in section but sometimes <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)" format="html" scope="external">cylindrical</xref> or <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle" format="html" scope="external">triangular</xref>, permanently bonded to the core. <image href="pencil.png" id="image_jjj_t5f_mzb"/>Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. <image placement="break" href="pencil.png" align="center" id="image_xcj_w5f_mzb"/>To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. <xref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_pencil" format="html" scope="external">Mechanical pencils</xref> have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or
            retracted (usually through the casing's tip) as needed. These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) as the previous ones are exhausted.</p>
